	<h2> Course Information </h2>
	<p> In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end
	(HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and
	practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
	
	<h2> Completed Course Assignments </h2>
	<h3> Lab 0 </h3>
	<p>In this lab, I installed Ubuntu 22.04 and software to go with it including Apache and git. I made sure that the Apache web server was working correctly. I then cloned both the course repository and my private repository to my VM using SSH keys. I edited my repo README and then pushed the changes to GitHub.</p>
	<h3> Lab 1 </h3>
	<p>In this lab, became familiar with the Wireshark program, understanding HTTP requests and responses. I also began basic web application programming. I created a helloworld and an HTML CGI application using C. I then did the same thing using PHP. Finally, used Wireshark and curl to better understand HTTP requests.</p>
	<h3> Lab 2 </h3>
	<p>In this lab, I created an HTML file where I did multiple exercises. I created a simple web page including a headshot and a form section with user inputs and buttons. I then learned how to incorporate JavaScript within HTML using script tags. After this, I learned about Ajax, CSS, jQuery and how to use Ajax and fetch for Web API integration.</p>
	<h3> Hackathon 1 </h3>
	<p>In this Hackathon, I had to figure how to make a JavaScript alert execute for 7 different levels of a webpage input. This involved injecting JS code in the URL, input box, and using external files. I then altered files from previous labs to validate and encode any inputs.</p>
