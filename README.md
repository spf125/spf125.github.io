# Project 1
## Overview

I created and deployed a personal website on github.io with information including my resume, name, headshot, and contact information. This includes a link to another HTML page with information about the course, Web Application Programming and Hacking (WAPH). The personal website includes the use of Bootstrap and a page tracker. It also includes basic JavaScript code, JQuery, Web APIs, and cookies.

## Creating and Deploying Webpage

Using github.io, I created an index.html file that similar to the HTML file created in Lab 2. I then created a waph.html file containing information about this course and its assignments. I committed these to the github repo, so they are now accessible as a webpage at [https://spf125.github.io/index.html](https://spf125.github.io/index.html).

### CSS template (Bootstrap)

To implement Bootstrap, I found a template from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/]. I then incorporated this into my current index.html file.
